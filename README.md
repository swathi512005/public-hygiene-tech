# Automated Hygiene Management System for Septic Tanks and Public Restrooms

This project presents an *automated hygiene management system* designed to enhance cleanliness and reduce manual maintenance in public facilities. By integrating high-pressure water jets, PIR occupancy sensors, and advanced odor sensors, the system ensures optimal sanitation through a series of automated responses.

## Project Overview
The system monitors air quality, detects restroom occupancy, and triggers various actions based on predefined conditions to maintain hygiene levels.

### Key Features
- *Odor Control*: Automatically activates scent dispensers if odor exceeds 15 ppm and initiates additional cycles if it persists.
- *Cleaning Automation*: Activates high-pressure water jets and initiates a full cleaning cycle in case of persistent odor or excessive septic tank odor.
- *Occupancy-based Flushing*: Uses PIR sensors to trigger automatic flushing when no human presence is detected, ensuring cleanliness after each use.
- *Automated Drainage*: Monitors odor levels in the septic tank to initiate drainage and prevent overflow.

### Project Structure
- *src*: Source code files for sensor integration and automation.
- *docs*: Documentation for the project, including setup and operation instructions.
- *assets*: Images and diagrams illustrating system architecture and workflow.

### System Architecture
The system combines several hardware components with custom software for automation:
- *Odor Sensors*: Monitor air quality and trigger the cleaning system.
- *PIR Sensors*: Detect restroom occupancy to optimize cleaning cycles.
- *High-Pressure Jets*: Maintain sanitation in the septic tank by mixing contaminants.
- *Automated Drainage*: Prevents overflow by monitoring and draining the septic tank contents.

### Future Enhancements
- *Machine Learning Integration*: Use historical data for predictive maintenance.
- *Remote Monitoring*: IoT integration for remote data tracking and management.

### Getting Started
1. *Install Dependencies*: Install necessary libraries and dependencies listed in the requirements.txt.
2. *Run the Program*: Execute the main script to start the automated system.
